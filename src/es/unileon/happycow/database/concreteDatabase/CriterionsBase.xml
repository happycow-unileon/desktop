        <help><![CDATA[Observe and check the distance to the animal before the animal refuses human contact.<br><br>Test at least half of the animals in a pen. 
            In the case of hard sizes ≥100, where sample size is less than 50% of the animals, randomly select the number of pens necessary to reach the sample size; 
            however proportions of weight classes should still be considered; the pens selected for the behavioural observations should be included.<br>
            <br>Place yourself on the feed bunk at a distance of 3 meters (if possible) in front of the animal to be tested. The head of the animal has to 
            be completely past the feeding rack / neck rail over the feed. If you do not have 3 meters in front of the animals in which to approach them, 
            then choose an angle of up to 45 degrees with the feeding rack, and start at a distance of 3.5 meters. If a distance of 3.5 meters is not possible,
             continue with the assessment but note down the maximum distance possible on the recording sheet.<br><br>Make sure that the animal is attentive or 
            is taking notice of your presence. If an animal is not obviously attentive, but also not clearly distracted, it can be tested. A way to attract the animals’
             attention is to make some movements in front of them (at the starting position).<br><br>﻿Approach the animal at a speed of one step per second and a 
            step length of approximately 60 cm with the arm held overhand at an angle of approximately 45°  from the body. When approaching, always direct the back
             of the hand toward the animal. Do not look into the animal’s eyes but look at the muzzle. Continue to walk towards the animal until signs of withdrawal
             occur, or until you can touch the nose/muzzle.<br><br>Withdrawal movement is defined as the following behaviours: the animal moves back, turns the head 
            to the side, or pulls back the head trying to get out of the feeding rack; head shaking can also be found.<br><br>In the case of withdrawal the avoidance
             distance is estimated (=distance between the hand and the muzzle at the moment of withdrawal) with a resolution of 10 cm (300 cm to 10 cm possible). 
            If withdrawal takes place at a distance lower than 10 cm, the test result is still 10 cm. If you can touch the nose/muzzle, an avoidance distance of 
            zero cm is recorded.<br><br>Make sure that the hand is always closest to the animal during the approach (not the knee or the feet). Especially when getting
             close to animals that are feeding or have their heads in a low position, bend a little in order to try to touch them.<br><br>Note that neighbouring animals
             react to an animal being tested and so should be tested later on. In order to reduce the risk of influencing the neighbour’s test result, every second 
            animal can be chosen. Retest animals at a later time if the reaction was unclear.]]></help>

        <help><![CDATA[Considers  the  expressive quality of how animals behave and interact with each other and their environment.<br><br>
            Qualitative  Behaviour  Assessment (QBA)  considers  the  expressive quality of how animals behave and interact 
            with each other and the environment, i.e. their ‘body language’.<br><br>Select between one and eight observation 
            points (depending on the size and structure of the farm) that together cover the different areas of the farm. 
            Decide the order to visit these observation points, wait a few minutes to allow the animals to return to undisturbed
             behaviour. Watch the animals that can be seen well from that point and observe the expressive quality of their 
            activity at group level. It is likely that the animals will initially be disturbed, but their response to this can
             be included in the assessment. Total observation time should not exceed 20 minutes, and so the time taken at each
             observation point depends on the number of points selected for a farm:<br><br>﻿When observation at all selected 
            points has been completed, find a quiet spot and score the 20 descriptors.Please note that scoring is not done 
            during observation, and that only one integrative assessment is made per farm.<br><br>The terms used for QBA in
